# CS497-HW3
1. This algorithm first stores the input list, O(N) traversal to read, in an array, O(N) traversal to store, for efficient access, which takes O(2N) time and O(N) space. It then calls a recursive function which stores the middle element of the array as the root, before calling itself on the left half of the array for the left subtree and the right for the right. This recusrion means it is called exactly once for each item in the array, so the time complexity is O(N), as array access is constant time. This continues until every element has been checked, which is when the function is called with the end greater than the beginning. The root node is then returned. Overall, this algoorithm has O(N) time complexity, as it is simply multiple O(N) functions strung together. The algorithm also uses O(N) extra space to store an array.
